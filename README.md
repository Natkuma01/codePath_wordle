## Notes

The major challenge is understanding how the structure is and the logic flow, especially for beginners. 
Another key part is learning and applying the built-in functions and UIKit components provided by Swift, 
such as UICollectionView, and gesture recognizers. Gaining familiarity with these tools and how they interact 
helps make the development process more manageable and efficient.
