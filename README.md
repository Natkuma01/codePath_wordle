# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Shimin Natalie Chan**

**Name of your app** is a word puzzle game where players try to guess a secret 5-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the letters are highlighted to give feedback: green for correct letters in the correct position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and gray for incorrect letters.

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- ✅ App displays a keyboard on the screen
- ✅ When tapping on the keyboard, a letter is shown or deleted (letter selected)
- ✅ User can play a basic version of Wordle, with different goal words each time

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- ✅ Improve and customize the user interface by adding a launchscreen and app icon
- ✅ Run the app on a device rather than in the simulator

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- ✅List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!


## Notes

The major challenge is understanding how the structure is and the logic flow, especially for beginners. 
Another key part is learning and applying the built-in functions and UIKit components provided by Swift, 
such as UICollectionView, and gesture recognizers. Gaining familiarity with these tools and how they interact 
helps make the development process more manageable and efficient.
